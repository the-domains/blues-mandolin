Bert Deivert & Copperhead Run have had a great year in 2015 and looking forward to lots of festival gigs in 2016\. Our album "Blood In My Eyes For You" has been picked by several critics for magazines, podcasts, and radio as one of the top blues albums of 2015\. Iain Patience, renowned writer for many blues magazines in the UK, Europe, and the US, has called it his "Album of the Year"! Thanks everybody for your support. We are happy to be touring and looking forward to meeting our fans in Europe and elsewhere! You can get in touch at my email for gig inquiries and album sales.  bdeivert@gmail.com ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/05dbc681-8209-4910-8cb7-34f28486d193.jpg)
